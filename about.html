            <h2>Hey, my name is Jenny</h2>
            <p>
                I am a UI Designer based in New York. Being a young adult just starting to navigate the adult world, I wasnâ€™t sure what I wanted to be in the future. I was in the medical field before this and upon doing a lot of research, I found interest in UX/UI. I always found myself to be a creative person who enjoys art and creating artwork. I also found interest in the tech industry and when I landed on UX/UI, I thought it was the perfect thing for me. I started my journey on CareerFoundry and learned essential skills, not only in UX/UI, but also front end development. With everything that I learned, I created a handful of projects that you see here and my goal now is to become the next best product designer.
